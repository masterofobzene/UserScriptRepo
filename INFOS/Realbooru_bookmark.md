### USE CASE:
--------------
Realbooru has the page numbers randomized in the URL, so for example you are browsing page 2 
and in the URL it will show something like "...pid=504" in the end where the page number should be. 
This creates the problem of not being able to come back to keep browsing from that page unless 
you take the time to make a bookmark, write it down or memorize it. This extension is way shorter than all this explanation 
and comes to fix that by letting you save the current url and load it later even after closing the browser. 
Neat!

### USAGE:
---------------
Just click the button to save the current page.
Click the same button to load the saved page even after you closed the browser.


### WHY?:
---------------
Useful to browse the whole site.
