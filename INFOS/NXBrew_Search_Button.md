### USE CASE:
--------------
Lazy game discovery and acquisition on NXBrew, using Nintendo's store as a catalog. 

### USAGE:
---------------
On each game card, you will have 1 big red button to search the game name on NXBrew.


### WHY?:
---------------
As with Steam and GOG too, it is way better to use Nintendo's store as a catalog to search for 
new games to download from clean sites later, having filtering options to avoid the wave of trash 
games that appear in NXBrew that has no filtering options.
