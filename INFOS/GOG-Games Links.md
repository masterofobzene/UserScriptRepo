### USE CASE:
--------------
Direct discovery of games on gog-games.

### USAGE:
---------------
Just click the big purple button to search for a gameplay video of the selected game without annoying youtubers 
screaming and mumbling word salads.


### WHY?:
---------------
Sometimes, you just want to see if "X" game is "available" on gog-games. The problem is that gog-games didn't have
the possibility to quickly search for gameplay videos. This userscript comes to fix that.
