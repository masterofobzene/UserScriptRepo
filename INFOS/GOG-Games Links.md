### USE CASE:
--------------
Direct discovery of games on gog-games.

### USAGE:
---------------
Just click the purple button to search for a gameplay video of the selected game without annoying youtubers 
screaming and mumbling word salads or click the orange button to HOPEFULLY get a changelog FROM STEAM.

DISCLAIMER: 
The script will search the steam "news hub" in an effort to show you a changelog of the game but there are many
conditions for this to serve its purpose:

1- I've chosen "steam news hub" to check for changelogs since developers focus more on steam than on gog releases of
their games; in other words, __they usually don't create changelogs for gog released games.__ Gogdb changelogs are 
mostly outdated for a lot of games.

2- Steam changelogs may differ from gog release of the same game in some aspects.

3- There may not be any changelogs or may be completely abandoned.


### WHY?:
---------------
Sometimes, you just want to see if "X" game is "available" on gog-games. The problem is that gog-games didn't have
the possibility to quickly search for gameplay videos and changelogs. This userscript comes to fix that.
