### USE CASE:
--------------
Direct discovery of games on gog-games.

### USAGE:
---------------
Just click the purple button to search for a gameplay video of the selected game without annoying youtubers 
screaming and mumbling word salads or click the orange button to HOPEFULLY get a changelog FROM STEAM.

DISCLAIMER: 
The script will search the dedicated steam "news hub" for the game using DuckDuckGo (because changelog pages
use the game numeric id instead of game name) in an effort to show you a changelog of the game but there are many conditions 
for this to serve its purpose:

1- It simply makes a search on DDG for the "steam news hub" for that specific game, you will have to click the result to get
there (usually "[GAMENAME] - Steam News Hub" result)

2- I've chosen "steam news hub" to check for changelogs since developers focus more on steam than on gog releases of
their games; in other words, __they usually don't create changelogs for gog released games.__ Gogdb changelogs are 
mostly outdated for a lot of games.

3- Steam changelogs may differ from gog release of the same game in some aspects.

4- There may not be any changelogs or may be completely abandoned.


### WHY?:
---------------
Sometimes, you just want to see if "X" game is "available" on gog-games. The problem is that gog-games didn't have
the possibility to quickly search for gameplay videos and changelogs. This userscript comes to fix that.
