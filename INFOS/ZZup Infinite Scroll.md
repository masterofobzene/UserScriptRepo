### USE CASE:
--------------
~~Lazy loading the whole page until the user clicks the button again to stop it. It re-paginates the site and 
loads each page of the gallery below the other, creating an "infinite scroll" experience.~~
The site is down since months, before going dark it impossed heavy restrictions on downloads.

### USAGE:
---------------
~~Just click the "Load Subsequent Pages" button to start paginating and CLICK AGAIN TO STOP IT!. You can resume 
loading more by clicking again. You control it.~~


### WHY?:
---------------
~~It is time consuming to go browsing each page and waiting for it to be loaded.~~
