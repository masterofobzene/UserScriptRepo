### USE CASE:
--------------
You can now filter stuff you don't want to see from specified users. This userscript will hide all their content 
in the main gallery search results. A red "X" button will appear on the users avatars so you can obliterate them
from you view forever. If you want to restore users open the code view of the userscript, then go to "values" and 
remove them (keep the format and commas). It is persistent so you don't have to do this each time you visit the site.
To put it clear, the sense in doing this is because you are effectively removing users from your sight site-wide so even 
if they uploaded more stuff on the site before or after, you will not see them again and all in one click!

UPDATE: It will also hide galleries with less than 4 pictures in them automatically.

UPDATE 2: Now a mini draggable panel will show 3 options to hide users by reported gender. It came to my attention that a lot
of "female" and "trans" users upload really weird stuff there. Be careful though that these options may hide "normal" content too.
Also, be aware that in some cases the code used to hide the gender may not be complete due to a site bug (?) and may not be filtered
but these are rather rare.
 
### USAGE:
---------------
Just click the red X button on the avatar of the offender. After applying to a user or many in the page, reload
so it applies to ALL instances of the same user.


### WHY?:
---------------
That site is a dump filled with weirdos trying to somehow convince people to become gay. The site doesn't offer 
any blocking features only if you sign you get some filtering by tags, but the weirdos don't use tags or use 
false ones to get exposition. The site doesn't mind that, it seems. So here is your tool to clean it. LGBT my ass, gender
dysphoria is not a virtue, nor normal.
