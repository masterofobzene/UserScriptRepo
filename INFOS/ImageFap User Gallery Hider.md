### USE CASE:
--------------
You can now filter stuff you don't want to see from specified users. This userscript will hide all their content 
in the main gallery search results. A red "X" button will appear on the users avatars so you can obliterate them
from you view forever. If you want to restore users open the code view of the userscript, then go to "values" and 
remove them (keep the format and commas). It is persistent so you don't have to do this each time you visit the site.
 
### USAGE:
---------------
Just click the red X button on the avatar of the offender. After applying to a user or many in the page, reload
so it applies to ALL instances of the same user.


### WHY?:
---------------
That site is a dump filled with weidos trying to somehow convince people to become gay. The site doesn't offer 
any blocking features only if you sign you get some filtering by tags, but the weirdos don't use tags or use 
false ones to get exposition. The site doesn't mind it seems. So here is your tool to fight back. LGBT my ass.
