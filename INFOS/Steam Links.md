### USE CASE:
--------------
Lazy game discovery and acquisition on clean sites, using Steam as a catalog. 

### USAGE:
---------------
On each game shop page, you will have 6 big green buttons, each will search for the game in
different known-to-be-safe dl sites. It also has one link to search for non-commented youtube gameplay
videos, and one for checking if the game has been "infected" with DEI policies by searching for it on
deidetected.com.


### WHY?:
---------------
Lazy game discovery/dl.
