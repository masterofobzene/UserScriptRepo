### USE CASE:
--------------
Filtering results in the pornolab search, effectively bypassing the need to use specific forums or extra searching 
(you can now leave the default option to search all the forum instead of having to tell it where).
It will remove results that contain any of the words that the user writes in the new filtering box but the good thing
is that it also removes results that have the offending words as the "forum" value (the sub forum) so this time you can
effectively remove all bad results that the people create by not using the correct tags, for example the elusive "gay"
tag that is not being used in the post names.
UPDATE: It will now unhide the pagination numbers so you don't get hidden pages and can browse easier.

### USAGE:
---------------
Input the words you want to match on offending results. It is persistent so you can save your list.


### WHY?:
---------------
Other pornolab filtering userscripts help to only filter results by topic title, which means if the post doesn't have
the correct tag in its name (very, very common) it will escape the filters. The most common example is the "gay" topic,
in which users upload to a special gay subforum and they don't see the need to write that word in their posts titles since they
are already posting on the gay subforum. This userscript will also remove the "gay" subforum results if you input 'gay' as a filter
word, because it also checks the subforum name (in this case "gay") and not only the topic (post) name to do the filtering. 

Other good uses are to temporarily filter all post having a determined resoultion (1080p, 720p, etc) so you can
easily tell which posts have media in those formats. You can then remove the word and see all resolutions again.
