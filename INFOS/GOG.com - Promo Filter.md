### USE CASE:
--------------
Making the catalog cleaner by removing "bundles", "special editions", "supporter editions" or "Original sountrack" game cards.

### USAGE:
---------------
You can customize this userscript with words you want or use it with the defaults which work pretty well.
To customize:

⚠ FOLLOW THE FORMAT. 
Add or remove words in this line:

```
const filterWords   = ['bundle', 'edition', 'supporter', 'halloween', 'christmas', 'soundtrack'];
```


### WHY?:
---------------
A cheap tactic to increase presence on the stores and get extra revenue from unsuspecting users, 
many developers make "editions" of their games, this repeats the game exposure in the stores.
This rather bad practices end up filling the catalogs with repeated games and its "special" versions.
This script eliminates that problem. This userscript has been made thinking on using GOG as a catalog
to know games and then download elsewere, so I do not care about special offers.
