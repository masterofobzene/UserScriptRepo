### USE CASE:
--------------
⚠ If prices are not in US dollars this extension requires you to either install [Force Steam US Dollars](https://github.com/masterofobzene/UserScriptRepo/raw/refs/heads/main/SFW/Force%20Steam%20US%20Dollars.user.js)
or manually modify it to set the correct prices in your local currency.

Filtering the search page to get a clean catalog. TL;DR: Now you have unlimited
tag filtering + minimum price filtering on Steam.

### USAGE:
---------------
On the right of your usual Steam search menu, you will find a new box to set a MINIMUM PRICE 
to show games; by rising this bar you will filter cheaper (mostly trash) games. It also has
one option to filter out games with "mixed/mostly negative" reviews and one to filter games
without reviews (⚠ warning as this last option will filter new games until they start getting 
reviewed).

### WHY?:
---------------
Steam is full of trash games. It is a sewer. "Troll games" everywhere, priced $0.80 and such. 
It was impossible to browse the catalog like that, so I did what Steam ACTIVELY REFUSED to do:
I created the long-waited MINIMUM PRICE filter that we all have been waiting. To extend its 
functionalities, I added further filters by using the reviews system. 
If you are thinking "why don't you simply use steamdb?" I answer you: steamdb has a hard-limit
on tags you can filter, meaning it is also useless. 
Enjoy browsing a clean, completely filtrable Steam catalog now!
