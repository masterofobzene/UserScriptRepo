### USE CASE:
--------------
To get a slightly realistic overview of videogames, hopefully bypassing simps that will say they love the game unconditionally and
of course, paid reviews.

### USAGE:
---------------
Just browse into a game description page.


### WHY?:
---------------
Nowadays we are surrounded by simps. Some of them are brand fans, some are gadgets fans, everybody is being turned into
a fanboy of some sort. Its the way the industries manipulate people and people seem to be way low on IQ lately to 
instantaneously need to identify themselves with brands and objects, so they exploit this. 
People bought the "hey this is me! look what I like!", poor souls need to do that.
Imagine how the reviews system works after this. A useful review is not a positive review anymore. So to save you one step
this userscript will automatically switch reviews to "negative" so all you will see are the negative reviews, but be aware
there are a lot of people giving bad reviews because they want to run Cyberpunk 2077 on a 2016 laptop. 

Use your brain and... READ.
