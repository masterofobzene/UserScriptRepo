### USE CASE:
--------------
It adds "negative words" to your search box automatically when you click on the desired options, helping you 
filter the startpage search results. Mostly recommended for searching software and filtering all those
"BEST 10..." lists sites that are made by AI nowadays.

### USAGE:
---------------
Click on the desired filter, a description of what they do follows:

```
NO BEST LISTS: Avoids "lists trash sites" e.g. "10 BEST IMAGE EDITORS".
NO ONLINE APPS: Avoids online services e.g. "online image cropper".
NO ADS: Removes some search results that are ads by google.
ONLY PDF: Useful for searching for manuals or books.
GITHUB SOFTWARE SEARCH: Searches only in github.com
NO LINUX: Avoids results showing support pages with linux discussions. Useful if you use Windows.
NO APPLE: Same than above, it extends the filter to IOS devices too.
NO MOBILE: Filters IOS and Android discussions.
NO HELP PAGES: Filters out support forums and pages.
```


### WHY?:
---------------
Search engines today NEED negative words to filter results, as they get more and more bloated with ads and 
fillers. This extension just makes life easier to the users so they don't have to use the special syntax to 
search.
