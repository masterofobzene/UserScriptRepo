### USE CASE:
--------------
In your location prices are shown in another currency. Either you want to use the price filter userscript [::Steam Search: Hide Games Under Minimum Price::](https://github.com/masterofobzene/UserScriptRepo/raw/main/SFW/--Steam%20Search-%20Hide%20Games%20Under%20Minimum%20Price--.user.js)
__and it is not working because it is not finding the correct values in dollars__ (the script expects dollars) 
or it is convenient for you to see the prices in dollars for some other reason.

### USAGE:
---------------
Just install it and search the game catalog, prices should be shown in US dollars.


### WHY?:
---------------
If Steam shows prices in your local currency, the script to filter by prices will not work (at least not by default) needing
you to either fix the prices listing by forcing prices in dollars (this userscript) or manually editing the userscript 
to use your currency. Most users will feel editing the script is too much for them and prefer to set prices in dollars instead.

You must have violentmonkey installed for this to work.
